## Introduction

Folio's i18n implementation is based on components provided by [react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl). The [Basic Internationalization Principles](https://formatjs.io/guides/basic-i18n/) and [React Internationalization – How To](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/01/internationalizing-react-apps/) guides mentioned there are worthwhile reads to get the lay of the land. Note that in addition to strings, dates and times also have locale-specific formats, e.g. dates in the US may be expressed as MM/DD/YYYY while in Europe they will be expressed as DD/MM/YYYY.

We store locale data in each app's `translations/` directory, e.g. `translations/en.json`, `translations/de.json` and use the components `<FormattedMessage>`, `<SafeHTMLMessage>`, and `<FormattedDate>`, and the methods `stripes.intl.formatMessage`, `stripes.formatDate`, `stripes.formatTime`, and `stripes.formatDateTime` to replace placeholder strings in the code with values loaded from those files. Please note that *all date and time data exchanged with the backend happens in UTC* and the `stripes` methods take care of handling timezone offsets and daylight saving time.

Our approach to providing rich-text markup, e.g. `The value <strong>{value}</strong> was removed.`, is to use HTML directly in the translation files and to use the `<SafeHTMLMessage>` component to display it. (HTML markup in values passed through `<FormattedMessage>` will be escaped, e.g. `<strong>` will be converted to `&amp;%lt;strong&gt;&amp;` whereas `<SafeHTMLMessage>` sanitizes it to remove dangerous code without escaping known-good values.)

At present, translations are maintained manually by direct editing of the `translations/*.json` files. Plans to integrate with [lokalise.co](https://lokalise.co/) are in progress. This will allow updates to files in a GitHub repository's translation directory to be pushed to Lokalise automatically, and will allow Lokalise to generate pull-requests against the repository when new translations are available.


## TL;DR

`stripes-core` adds locale and timezone information to React's context so you don't need to worry about that.

All date and time data exchanged with the backend happens in UTC. The `stripes` date and time functions know this and handle it accordingly.

For plain strings, e.g. "The {value} was removed." use `this.props.stripes.intl.formatMessage({ id: 'the.message.id' }, { value: "Moose" })` to receive a string or, `import { FormattedMessage } from 'react-intl'; ... const message = <FormattedMessage id="the.message.id" values={{ value: "Flying Squirrel" }}/>` to receive a component.

For HTML strings, e.g. "The value <strong>{value}</strong> was removed.", use `import SafeHTMLMessage from '@folio/react-intl-safe-html'; ... const message = <SafeHTMLMessage id="the.message.id" values={{ value: "Frostbite Falls" }}/>`.

For date and time values, use `import { FormattedDate } from 'react-intl'; ... const message = <FormattedDate value={item.metadata.updatedDate} />` or the methods on `this.props.stripes`: `formatDate(loan.dueDate)`, `formatTime(loan.dueDate)`, or `formatDateTime(loan.dueDate)`.


## Details

`stripes-core` adds locale and timezone information to React's context so you don't need to worry about providing that information when formatting your strings; you can simply use the available components or `stripes` methods with the knowledge that they have already been correctly initialized.

Keys in libraries have the name of the library automatically prefixed, e.g. a key named `search` in `stripes-components/translations/en.json` would be accessible in `stripes-components/lib/SomeClass.js` as `stripes-components.search`. Keys in apps have the name of the app automatically prefixed, e.g. a key named `search` in `ui-users/translations/en.json` would be accessible in `ui-users/SomeClass.js` as `ui-users.search`.

`react-intl` uses [ICU Message Syntax](https://formatjs.io/guides/message-syntax/) to handle variable substitution in the values. In its simplest form, the argument is assumed to be a string and the placeholder in the value is replaced with the argument. e.g. given `{ name: "Natasha" }`, the value

```
"borisSays": "Please, {name}. This is kiddie show."
```
would be returned as
```
Please, Natasha. This is kiddie show.
```
Formatted values are given as `{key, type [, format]}`, e.g.
```
"resultCount": "{count, number} {count, plural, one {Record found} other {Records found}}",
```
Here, the same argument `count` is formatted in two different ways; once as the type "number" and once as the type "plural". A ["number"](https://formatjs.io/guides/message-syntax/#number-type) without a formatter is handled the same way as a string; the value is simply replaced by the argument. A ["plural"](https://formatjs.io/guides/message-syntax/#plural-format) works similar to a switch statement operating on the argument, which is interpreted as a number whose values are matched against the keys in the third argument. For example, `formatMessage({ id: 'ui-users.resultCount' }, { count: 1 })` would return "1 Record found" whereas `formatMessage({ id: 'ui-users.resultCount' }, { count: 99 })` would return "99 Records found".

### Dates and times

All date and time data exchanged with the backend happens in UTC. The formatters provided on the `stripes` object will take care of formatting it correctly for the tenant's locale and correctly handling the offset from UTC, including daylight saving time, for the tenant's timezone. Please *do not write your own date-formatters*.

For date and time values, use `import { FormattedDate } from 'react-intl'; ... const message = <FormattedDate value={item.metadata.updatedDate} />` or the methods on `this.props.stripes`: `formatDate(loan.dueDate)`, `formatTime(loan.dueDate)`, or `formatDateTime(loan.dueDate)`.


## Examples

`translations/en.json`
```
{
  "search": "Search",
  "resultCount": "{count, number} {count, plural, one {Record found} other {Records found}}",

  "cv.cannotDeleteTermMessage": "This {type} cannot be deleted, as it is in use by one or more records.",
  "cv.numberOfObjects": "# of {objects}",
  "cv.termDeleted": "The {type} <b>{term}</b> was successfully <b>deleted</b>"
  }
```

```
import { FormattedDate, FormattedMessage } from 'react-intl';
import SafeHTMLMessage from '@folio/react-intl-safe-html';

class ControlledVocab extends React.Component {
  static propTypes = {
    stripes: PropTypes.shape({
      intl: PropTypes.shape({
        formatMessage: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
      }).isRequired,
    }).isRequired,
  };

  getHtmlMessage(item) {
    const message = (
      <SafeHTMLMessage
        id="stripes-smart-components.cv.termDeleted"
        values={{
          type: this.props.labelSingular.toLowerCase(),
          term: item[this.state.primaryField],
        }}
      />
    );

    return message;
  }

  getTextMessage(item) {
    const message = (
      <Col xs>
        <FormattedMessage id="stripes-smart-components.cv.cannotDeleteTermMessage" values={{ type: item.type }} />
      </Col>
    );

    return message;
  }

  getTextString(item) {
    return this.props.stripes.intl.formatMessage({ id: 'stripes-smart-components.cv.numberOfObjects' }, { objects: this.props.objectLabel });
  }

  getDate(item) {
    return <FormattedDate value={item.metadata.updatedDate} />;
  }
}
```
